Weekly Programmer - Week 9
==========================

A Program a Day Keeps the Doctor Away
-------------------------------------

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

Description
-----------

This week, instead of one challenge I've created five mini challenges!

### Day One

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 40?

### Day Two

A palindromic number reads the same forwards as backwards. What is the smallest Palindrome number that is the product of
three 3-digit numbers?

### Day Three

A derangement of an ordered set is any ordered set containing the same members as the original set where no set member
is in the same position as it is in the original set.

For example, given the set `ABC`: `BCA` is a derangement but `CBA` is not.

Given an ordered input set (a List or Array) produce a random derangement of the input.

### Day Four

Given an input set (as a List or Array) randomize the input in place. For full credit use as little library code as
possible and the only source of randomization you can use should produce random numbers from the range `[0-1)` Your
solution should be capable of producing any permutation of the input set with equal probability, not just the derangements.

### Day Five

Humans sort things weirdly. We sort alphabetically, but treat numbers special. a human would never sort `book 10`
before `book 2` because ten is bigger than 2.

Given an unordered input set (as a List or Array) produce an ordered output according to the human "natural sort" rules.
