Baum-Sweet Sequence
-------------------

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

Description
-----------

In mathematics, the Baumâ€“Sweet sequence is an infinite automatic sequence of `0`s and `1`s defined by the rule:

* $b_{n}$ = `1` if the binary representation of n contains no block of consecutive `0`s of odd length;
* $b_{n}$ = `0` otherwise;

for $n$ >= `0`.

For example, $b_{4}$ = `1` because the binary representation of `4` is `100`, which only contains one block of consecutive
`0`s of length `2`; whereas $b_{5}$ = `0` because the binary representation of `5` is `101`, which contains a block of
consecutive `0`s of length `1`. When $n$ is `19611206`, $b_{19611206}$ is `0` because:

```text
19611206 = 1001010110011111001000110 base 2
            00 0 0  00     00 000  0 runs of 0s
               ^ ^            ^^^    odd length sequence
```

Because we find an odd length sequence of `0`s, $b_{19611206}$ is `0`.

Challenge Description
---------------------

Your challenge today is to write a program that generates the Baum-Sweet sequence from 0 to some number $n$. For example,
given `"20"` your program would emit:

`1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0`

Example Solution
----------------

Language: Javascript

```javascript
const baumSweet = n => /1(00)*0(1|$)/.test(n.toString(2)) ? 0 : 1;
const baumSweetSeq = n => new Array(n + 1).fill().map((_,n) => baumSweet(n));
console.log(baumSweetSeq(20).join(', '));
```

Solution Explanation
--------------------

Breaking this down the core of the solution is the `baumSweet` function. This function takes a number and returns the
baumsweet number for it. The conversion is performed via regular expression matching.

We know that:

* any binary number starts with a `1` (Leading zeros are not produced by the Numeric toString method)
* an odd length sequence of `0` is zero or more instances of `00` followed by a lone `0`

Using these two facts we construct the regular expression `/1(00)*0(1|$)/`, that is "Match `1` followed by zero or more
repetitions of `00`, followed by `0`, followed by `1` or end of input. Using this regular expression we test the base 2
representation of the input number and return `0` if there is a match and `1` otherwise.

The other bit of subtlty appears in the `baumSweetSeq` function. In Javascript creating an array with the `new` operator
creates a sparse array, so the `fill()` method is invoked to fill the sparse array with `undefined`s, that allows
the `map()` command to be used to pass the indexes into the `baumSweet()` function.
