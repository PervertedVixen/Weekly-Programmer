# Weekly Programmer - Week 15

## Spatial Programming

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

## Description

Given a text input, find the area of the largest contiguous non-whitespace region.

For example, given the following input the expected output would be `20`:

```text
    flow        to
waterfall    apple
river  on      sex
```

## Bonus Challenge

If the input does not consist of colinear points perform linear regression on them to derive the closest matching line
in the form of $Y = mX +b$. Output the best fit line and an indication of the accuracy of the fit to the inputted points.

## Challenge Inputs

1. Single Line Unified Characters
    ```text
    *   ******* ***
    ```

1. Multiline Mixed Characters
    ```text
        flow        to
    waterfall    apple
    river  on      sex
    ```
