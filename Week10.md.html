# Weekly Programmer - Week 10

## The Battle Room

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

## Description

Write a program that calculates battle grids for the battle school. These battle grids are squares subdivided into a
series of squares. Each sub square may be empty or it may contain a star. Each star may not border another star
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Additionally every row and column of the battlegrid must contain the same
number of stars. Your program should be capable of generating valid battle grids of a certain size and fill rate based
on the inputs received.

## Formal Inputs & Outputs

### Input Description

Input will be two positive integers.

The first integer represents the primality of the grid, that is how many cells on a side the battle grid is. An input
of `4` means the battlegrid a 4x4 grid.

The second represents the fill rate, It is the number of stars that should be in each row and column. An input of `5`
means that the battlegrid must have 5 stars in every row and every column.

Example input:

```text
4, 1
```

### Output description

Output a visualization of the battlegrid, or an error message if there is no valid battlegrid

For example for the inputs `4, 1` you might output this grid:

```text
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   | * |   |
+---+---+---+---+
| * |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | * |
+---+---+---+---+
|   | * |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
```

## Challenge Inputs

1) small grid: `6, 1`
2) medium grid 1: `10, 2`
3) medium grid 2: `15, 3`
4) large grid: `32, 4`
5) impossible grid 1: `4, 2`
6) impossible grid 2: `3, 6`
