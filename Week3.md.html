# Weekly Programmer - Week 3

## Making Change

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

## Description

You own a nice tiny mini-market that sells candies to children. You need to know what change to give back to those
little cute creatures and it happens you don't know basic math because when you were a child you were always eating
candies and did not study very well. So you need some help from a little tool that tell you if you can.

## Challenge Description

Write a program that calculates change and outputs the minimum amount of coins needed to produce the required change.

Your program should receive as input the values of coins available to use, and the value of change needed as a decimal
amount of dollars. If the exact amount is not satisfiable your program should round up to the next highest satisfiable
value and output the coins needed for that.

Your program should output the coins required to give the correct change.

For example:

Input:

```text
.5 .25 .1 .05 .01
1.24
```

Output:

```text
.5 .5 .1 .1 .01 .01 .01 .01
```

## Challenge Inputs

```text
1 .5 .25 .1 .05 .01
4.99
```

```text
1 .5 .25 .1 .05
4.89
```

```text
1 .5 .25 .1 .05 .01
.66
```

```text
5 2 .5 .25 .1 .05
16.01
```

```text
1 .5 .25 .1
.3
```

## Example Solution

```javascript
const makeChange = (target, coins) => {
    const factor = Math.pow(10, coins.concat(target)
        .map(x => /\d+(.(\d*))?/.exec(x)[2] || '')
        .reduce((a, v) => Math.max(v.length, a), 0));
    target = Math.round(target * factor);
    coins = coins.map(x => Math.round(x * factor));
    const values = [0];
    let i = 0;
    for (; i < target; i++) {
        if (i in values) {
            coins.forEach(coin => {
                const next = i + coin;
                if (!(next in values)) {
                    values[next] = coin
                }
            });
        }
    }
    i = target;
    while (!(i in values)) {
        i++;
    }
    const solution = [];
    for (; i > 0; i -= values[i]) {
        solution[i - 1] = values[i];
    }
    return solution.filter(value => value)
        .map(coin => coin / factor)
        .sort((a, b) => b - a)
};
console.log(makeChange(1.24, [.5, .25, .1, .05, .01,]));
```

## Solution Explanation

This solution applies a breadcrumb strategy for backtracking. First the values of the coins are scaled up to make the
values integer and the scaling factor is saved. This allows the algorithm to work only with integers and scale the
result back down to decimals at the end.

Next a list of reachable coin values is created. Starting at `0` the available coins are added to that sum and their
numeric value is stored at the new sum. If the new sum already has a value stored it is preserved as that means a
shorter path to the reachable value was already produced. This process is repeated for every reachable value up to the
target amount of change.

This storage allows the single list of values to contain not only which values are reachable but starting from any given
value there is a trail of breadcrumbs leading back to `0` which gives the shortest path, and thus the smallest number of
coins needed to produce the needed sum.

Once this list is generated the smallest reachable value that is at least as great as the needed sum is chosen and the
trail of breadcrumbs is walked back to `0`. This list of coins is then sorted largest to smallest and reduced by the
previously stored factor to give the result in the original input units.
