# Weekly Programmer - Week 11

## Oh My Gosh! It's Full of Triangles

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

## Description

Write a program that accepts a triangular grid as an input and produces the largest sum of a tree traversal.

For Example, observe the following grid.

```text
   3
  7 4
 2 4 6
8 5 9 3
```

The Maximum sum traversing this tree is `23` which is achieved by starting on the initial `3` and moving through `7`,
`4`, and `9`.

## Formal Inputs & Outputs

### Input Description

The imput will be represented as a left aligned triangular grid of numbers. For example, the grid described above will
be represented as:

```text
3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3
```

### Output Description

#### Easy Mode

You should output the maximal sum of the traversal of your triangular grid. It is not necessary to output the path the
generated the sum.

#### Hard Mode

You should output both the maximal sum of the traversal and the path that generated the sum.
