# Weekly Programmer - Week 2

## Sum of Many Primes

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

## Description

The sum of the primes below 10 is `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17`.

What is the sum of the primes less than ten million?

## Challenge Description

Your challenge today is to write a program that computes all the primes less
than ten million and produce the sum of those primes.

Calculating what numbers are prime is quite tricky, but a sufficiently clever
algorithm should be able to produce the answer required for this challenge in
ten seconds or less.

## Bonus Challenge

1) Finding the primes less than ten million in less than ten seconds is
impressive. Can you find the primes less than a hundred million in less than
twenty? What about a billion? How far can you go before your algorithm fails to
complete the challenge in less than a minute?

2) Finding lists of primes online is easy, can you write a program to consume
such a list and produce on demand the sum of all primes under $n$? (where $n$ is
within the range of the list used)

## Expected Output

The expected sum is: `3203324994356`

## Example Solution

Language: Javascript

```javascript
const sieve = (limit) => {
    primegrid = new Array(limit + 1).fill(1)
    primegrid[0] = 0
    primegrid[1] = 0
    K = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(limit))
    for (i = 2; i < K; i++) {
        if (primegrid[i] !== 1) {
            continue;
        }
        for (j = i * i; j <= limit; j += i) {
            primegrid[j] = 0;
        }
    }
    return primegrid
        .map((isprime, num) => isprime === 1 ? num : undefined)
        .filter(a => a)
}
console.log(sieve(1e7).reduce((acc, prime) => acc + prime, 0))
```

## Solution Explanation

The core of this solution is an implementation of the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

The basic Sive uses an array with indexes up to (and including) $n$ filled with `1`s to indicate primes. `0` and `1` are
marked as non prime and the Sieve process indexes from `2` up to $\sqrt{n}$. We are able to stop processing at $\sqrt{n}$
because as we process each $index$ the smallest non-marked composite number that is a multiple of a prime is always the
square of the prime because if it was smaller than that another, smaller, prime would have already marked it as composite.

For each $index$ in this range of $n$, if the value is `0` $index$ is not prime and should be skipped. In the case that
$index$ has the value `1` the number is prime, all multiples of $index$ starting at $index^2$ are marked as not prime.
Once the sieve completes the grid is transformed into a list of prime numbers and returned to be summed.
