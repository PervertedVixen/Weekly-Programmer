# Weekly Programmer - Week 16

## Lists From a Single Direction

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

## Description

Using only the language primitives (and standard library where applicable) of your chosen language, implement a singly
linked list that implements the following operations:

* Prepend element to List
* Append element to List
* Add element at arbitrary index
* Remove first element in list
* Remove last element in list
* Remove element at arbitrary index
* Retrieve element at index

The singly linked list should be typesafe to the extent your chosen language allows.

## Bonus challenges

1. Create a unit test suite that proves the functionality of your list
1. Make your list thread safe
1. Add additional operations to your list
    * For example: Add an iterator
