# Weekly Programmer - Week 4

## Recurring characters

From [Weekly Programmer Challenges](./index.html)

## Description

Write a program that outputs the first recurring character in a string.

## Formal Inputs & Outputs

### Input Description

A string of alphabetical characters. Example:

```text
ABCDEBC
```

### Output description

The first recurring character from the input. From the above example:

```text
B
```

Alternatively provide additional info in the output, such as this example that providdes the solution to the basic
problem and the bonus as well.

```text
PXLJOUDJVZGQHLBHGXIW => `J`@3 (`X`[16])
```

This shows the first repeatching character is `J` at index 3 (zero based because that's the only correct way) and the
character with the longest recurrence is `X` with a gap of 16 characters

## Challenge Inputs

```text
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

```text
IKEUNFUVFV
```

```text
PXLJOUDJVZGQHLBHGXIW
```

```text
*l1J?)yn%R[}9~1"=k7]9;0[$
```

```text
156248267293222
```

```text
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

## Bonus Problem

Instead of outputting the first recurring character output the character
with the largest gap between an occurrence and next occurrence.

## Example Solution

```javascript
const calculateRecurrence = (str) => {
    const map = {};
    let first = null;
    let position = -1;
    let char = null;
    let gap = -1;
    `${str}`.split('').forEach((c, i) => {
        if (map[c]) {
            if (!first) {
                first = c;
                position = map[c];
            }
            if (i - map[c] > gap) {
                char = c;
                gap = i - map[c];
            }
        }
        map[c] = i;
    });
    return { first, position, char, gap, str };
};
```
